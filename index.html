      <h1>What is Success?</h1>
      <p>
        Success is a term misinterpreted by many people. Success is real
        success. It is a person or thing that has achieved a “good result by
        acceptable means” and been successful, or the fact of achieving
        something that you have been intending to do or garner by acceptable
        means. Underscore the phrase ‘good result by acceptable means’, the sole
        criterion by which success is measured. Yes, only a good result is what
        we call success. A good result or success denotes the utilisation of the
        right way. For a good result to be called good, it ‘must’ be generated
        from the execution of the right way.
