Bill Summaries Generated by AI 

Bill summarization, often a laborious and time-intensive task, can pose challenges, particularly when Congressional Research Service (CRS) summaries are unavailable. Recognizing the need for efficiency amid tight budgets and increased demands on staffers, Legis1 harnesses the power of AI to streamline the summarization process and provides AI-generated summaries for all current legislation in Congress. Additionally, Legis1 offers access to human-written CRS summaries when available, presenting staffers with a range of efficient options for comprehending proposed legislation. 

Create a Legislative Branch Staff Directory 

Legis1 boasts a comprehensive legislative staff directory, elevated with insightful analytics regarding each member’s office staff. The Legis1 staff directory includes a staffer’s phone, email, legislative issues in their portfolio, and their congressional work history. Legis1 has also developed and included the Staffer’s network on their profile, showing you which other staffers, committees, and legislators a staffer is connected to. By offering visibility into staffers’ backgrounds, and quarterly compensation, including their employment with other members or committees, Legis1 facilitates building and cultivating meaningful connections, thereby fostering efficient collaboration.  

Another major challenge identified in the Hackathon summary report, “Current directories lack information about staff members’ issue areas, making it challenging to identify the right contact for specific matters.” Legis1’s staffer search area provides the opportunity to search all staff by issue area.
